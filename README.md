# note-taker
A Firefox add-on that adds a text box to a toolbar button for taking notes.

Created because of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6ju4n7/im_looking_for_a_firefox_addon_that_gives_you_a/) reddit post.  
Click the toolbar button and a pop-up with a text box will open. Type anything there and it will be saved for later!

[Documentation for options](https://github.com/Rayquaza01/note-taker/wiki/Options).
