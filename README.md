# note-taker
A Firefox addon that adds a text box to a toolbar button for taking notes.

Created because of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6ju4n7/im_looking_for_a_firefox_addon_that_gives_you_a/) reddit post.  
Click the toolbar button and a popup with a textbox will open. Type anything there and it will be saved for later!

The icon is from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
