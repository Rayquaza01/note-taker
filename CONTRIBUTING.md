# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code, please submit a Pull Request with the changes you would like to make.

Please use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure your code is in a similar style to the rest before submitting your PR. A `eslintrc.json` file is included in the repo.

I will likely merge your PR if it works as intended and does not break other features.
